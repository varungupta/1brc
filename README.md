My rust implementation for 1 Billion Row Challenge. [https://1brc.dev]

The objective is to write a program that retrieves temperature measurement values from a text file and calculates the min, mean, and max temperature per weather station. The file has 1,000,000,000 rows! That's more than 10 GB of data.

While the official challenge - which was for Java implementations - ended  in Jan 2024, this implementation is an effort to go deeper with rust toolkit to get the best (min) execution time possible. Secondary objectve would be to use minimum memory.

Execution time and Memory usage for each implementation will be recorded here in this file.

Naive implemention will be the first one to establish the baseline.
Subsequent implementations will be committed to the repo with main.rs always reflectng the latest implementation.
